  abstract = {The United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) commit significant support to open-source data and software resources in order to foment reproducibility in the biomedical imaging sciences. Here, we report and evaluate a recent product of this commitment: Advanced Neuroimaging Tools (ANTs), which is approaching its 2.0 release. The ANTs open source software library consists of a suite of state-of-the-art image registration, segmentation and template building tools for quantitative morphometric analysis. In this work, we use ANTs to quantify, for the first time, the impact of similarity metrics on the affine and deformable components of a template-based normalization study. We detail the ANTs implementation of three similarity metrics: squared intensity difference, a new and faster cross-correlation, and voxel-wise mutual information. We then use two-fold cross-validation to compare their performance on openly available, manually labeled, T1-weighted MRI brain image data of 40 subjects (UCLA's LPBA40 dataset). We report evaluation results on cortical and whole brain labels for both the affine and deformable components of the registration. Results indicate that the best ANTs methods are competitive with existing brain extraction results (Jaccard = 0.958) and cortical labeling approaches. Mutual information affine mapping combined with cross-correlation diffeomorphic mapping gave the best cortical labeling results (Jaccard = 0.669 ± 0.022). Furthermore, our two-fold cross-validation allows us to quantify the similarity of templates derived from different subgroups. Our open code, data and evaluation scripts set performance benchmark parameters for this state-of-the-art toolkit. This is the first study to use a consistent transformation framework to provide a reproducible evaluation of the isolated effect of the similarity metric on optimal template construction and brain labeling.},

Accordingly, most scientific journals require authors to report experimental procedures in sufficient detail for independent researchers to replicate their work. To what extent do research reports in the functional neuroimaging literature live up to this standard? The present study evaluated methods reporting and methodological choices across 241 recent fMRI articles. Many studies did not report critical methodological details with regard to experimental design, data acquisition, and analysis. Further, many studies were underpowered to detect any but the largest statistical effects. Finally, data collection and analysis methods were highly flexible across studies, with nearly as many unique analysis pipelines as there were studies in the sample. Because the rate of false positive results is thought to increase with the flexibility of experimental designs, the field of functional neuroimaging may be particularly vulnerable to false positives. In sum, the present study documented significant gaps in methods reporting among fMRI studies. Improved methodological descriptions in research reports would yield significant benefits for the field.},

  abstract = {Rationale and Objectives
We present a new method for automatic brain extraction on structural magnetic resonance images, based on a multi-atlas registration framework.
Materials and Methods
Our method addresses fundamental challenges of multi-atlas approaches. To overcome the difficulties arising from the variability of imaging characteristics between studies, we propose a study-specific template selection strategy, by which we select a set of templates that best represent the anatomical variations within the data set. Against the difficulties of registering brain images with skull, we use a particularly adapted registration algorithm that is more robust to large variations between images, as it adaptively aligns different regions of the two images based not only on their similarity but also on the reliability of the matching between images. Finally, a spatially adaptive weighted voting strategy, which uses the ranking of Jacobian determinant values to measure the local similarity between the template and the target images, is applied for combining coregistered template masks.
Results
The method is validated on three different public data sets and obtained a higher accuracy than recent state-of-the-art brain extraction methods. Also, the proposed method is successfully applied on several recent imaging studies, each containing thousands of magnetic resonance images, thus reducing the manual correction time significantly.
Conclusions
The new method, available as a stand-alone software package for public use, provides a robust and accurate brain extraction tool applicable for both clinical use and large population studies.},

  abstract = {Brain lesion localization in multiple sclerosis (MS) is thought to be associated with the type and severity of adverse health effects. However, several factors hinder statistical analyses of such associations using large MRI datasets: 1) spatial registration algorithms developed for healthy individuals may be less effective on diseased brains and lead to different spatial distributions of lesions; 2) interpretation of results requires the careful selection of confounders; and 3) most approaches have focused on voxel-wise regression approaches. In this paper, we evaluated the performance of five registration algorithms and observed that conclusions regarding lesion localization can vary substantially with the choice of registration algorithm. Methods for dealing with confounding factors due to differences in disease duration and local lesion volume are introduced. Voxel-wise regression is then extended by the introduction of a metric that measures the distance between a patient-specific lesion mask and the population prevalence map.},

  abstract = {Background
Brain atrophy studies often use FSL-BET (Brain Extraction Tool) as the first step of image processing. Default BET does not always give satisfactory results on 3DT1 MR images, which negatively impacts atrophy measurements. Finding the right alternative BET settings can be a difficult and time-consuming task, which can introduce unwanted variability.
Aim
To systematically analyze the performance of BET in images of MS patients by varying its parameters and options combinations, and quantitatively comparing its results to a manual gold standard.
Methods
Images from 159 MS patients were selected from different MAGNIMS consortium centers, and 16 different 3DT1 acquisition protocols at 1.5 T or 3 T. Before running BET, one of three pre-processing pipelines was applied: (1) no pre-processing, (2) removal of neck slices, or (3) additional N3 inhomogeneity correction. Then BET was applied, systematically varying the fractional intensity threshold (the “f” parameter) and with either one of the main BET options (“B” — bias field correction and neck cleanup, “R” — robust brain center estimation, or “S” — eye and optic nerve cleanup) or none. For comparison, intracranial cavity masks were manually created for all image volumes. FSL-FAST (FMRIB's Automated Segmentation Tool) tissue-type segmentation was run on all BET output images and on the image volumes masked with the manual intracranial cavity masks (thus creating the gold-standard tissue masks). The resulting brain tissue masks were quantitatively compared to the gold standard using Dice overlap coefficient (DOC). Normalized brain volumes (NBV) were calculated with SIENAX. NBV values obtained using for SIENAX other BET settings than default were compared to gold standard NBV with the paired t-test.
Results
The parameter/preprocessing/options combinations resulted in 20,988 BET runs. The median DOC for default BET (f = 0.5, g = 0) was 0.913 (range 0.321–0.977) across all 159 native scans. For all acquisition protocols, brain extraction was substantially improved for lower values of “f” than the default value. Using native images, optimum BET performance was observed for f = 0.2 with option “B”, giving median DOC = 0.979 (range 0.867–0.994). Using neck removal before BET, optimum BET performance was observed for f = 0.1 with option “B”, giving median DOC 0.983 (range 0.844–0.996). Using the above BET-options for SIENAX instead of default, the NBV values obtained from images after neck removal with f = 0.1 and option “B” did not differ statistically from NBV values obtained with gold-standard.
Conclusion
Although default BET performs reasonably well on most 3DT1 images of MS patients, the performance can be improved substantially. The removal of the neck slices, either externally or within BET, has a marked positive effect on the brain extraction quality. BET option “B” with f = 0.1 after removal of the neck slices seems to work best for all acquisition protocols.},

  abstract = {An automated method for segmenting magnetic resonance head images into brain and non-brain has been developed. It is very robust and accurate and has been tested on thousands of data sets from a wide variety of scanners and taken with a wide variety of MR sequences. The method, Brain Extraction Tool (BET), uses a deformable model that evolves to fit the brain's surface by the application of a set of locally adaptive model forces. The method is very fast and requires no preregistration or other pre-processing before being applied. We describe the new method and give examples of results and the results of extensive quantitative testing against {"}gold-standard{"} hand segmentations, and two other popular automated methods.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Detecting incidence and enlargement of lesions is essential in monitoring the progression of MS. In clinical trials, lesion load is observed by manually segmenting and comparing serial MR images, which is time consuming, costly, and prone to inter- and intraobserver variability. Subtracting images from consecutive time points nulls stable lesions, leaving only new lesion activity. We propose SuBLIME, an automated method for segmenting incident lesion voxels.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used logistic regression models incorporating multiple MR imaging sequences and subtraction images from consecutive longitudinal studies to estimate voxel-level probabilities of lesion incidence. We used T1-weighted, T2-weighted, FLAIR, and PD volumes from a total of 110 MR imaging studies from 10 subjects.
RESULTS: To assess the performance of the model, we assigned 5 subjects to a training set and the remaining 5 to a validation set. With SuBLIME, lesion incidence is detected and delineated in the validation set with an AUC of 99\% (95\% CI [97\%, 100\%]) at the voxel level.
CONCLUSIONS: This fully automated and computationally fast method allows sensitive and specific detection of lesion incidence that can be applied to large collections of images. Using the explicit form of the statistical model, SuBLIME can easily be adapted to cases when more or fewer imaging sequences are available.},

  abstract = {Exclusion of non-brain matter in functional magnetic resonance imaging is required for performing functional localization in particular, as well as functional image analysis in general. This paper presents a comparison of the commonly used brain masking techniques in functional magnetic resonance imaging. In addition, a masking algorithm based on connected components analysis along with Gaussian smoothing is introduced. The contiguous binary brain mask obtained by the new algorithm is shown to be more effective than the ones obtained by the commonly deployed masking algorithms. The introduced algorithm can also be applied to different image modalities that need to be registered to the space of anatomy or to the native space of echo planar images.},
